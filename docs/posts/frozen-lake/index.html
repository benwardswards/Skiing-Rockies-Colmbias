From there, follow the groomed cross country Elk Pass trail until you reach the turn off for Blueberry Hill. You have two options from here. The first option is to continue along the Blueberry Pass trail for approximately one kilometer before making your way up to Fox Ridge. The skiing is fairly steep through thick forest but you may avoid heading North or South. Alternatively, you can choose to stay on the flat terrain leading towards Fox Lake and then ascend via the summer trail located on the Alberta-British Columbia border.</p><h2 id=east-aspect-below-frozen-lake-to-fox-lake>East aspect Below Frozen Lake to Fox Lake</h2><p>The open avalanche slope lookers left often catch down drafting west winds but offer 200m of good skiing. Lookers right, there is 125m runs of excellent Larch trees for skiing. However, beyond that point, the forest becomes too dense and tight for enjoyable skiing.</p><p><img src=./east_aspect_below_Frozen_lakes.jpg alt="East aspect underneath Frozen Lake"></p><h2 id=fox-ridge-north-avalanche-paths>Fox Ridge North avalanche paths</h2><p>Arguably the best skiing in the area. There is 250m ski lines consisting of avalanche chutes which increase in risk from lookers left to right. The creek can be followed out to the blueberry hill trail (the rolling flats might require skins). The two far lookers right chutes have cross-loaded start zones and I haven&rsquo;t skies them yet.</p><p><img src=Fox_Ridge_North.jpg alt="North Aspect off Fox Ridge"></p><p><img src=Steep_chute_Fox_north.jpg alt="Looking down at cross-loaded chute toward Kananaskis Lakes"></p><h2 id=ne-trees-of-fox-ridge>NE Trees of Fox Ridge</h2><p>There is 200m of good skiing from the top of the ridge but the last 150m of vertical back to the Blueberry hill trail is quite tight.</p><h2 id=fox-ridge-south-slopes-to-frozen-lake>Fox Ridge South slopes to Frozen Lake</h2><p>The short but steep open slopes lead to the lake; however, it&rsquo;s important to note that the terrain poses a risk as it becomes a potential trap due to the sudden change in slope onto the lake. I have skied the Mature trees down to the lake, but the trees have some flagging indicated that avalanches occasionally go through the trees.</p><p><img src=FoxRidge_Sourth_aspect.jpg alt="Fox Ridge South aspect.  I&rsquo;ve skied the denser trees mid picture, the steep slopes end in a flat lake so I haven&rsquo;t skied them.

Descending halfway to the Blueberry Hill lookout towards the Elk Pass trail is not recommended due to tight terrain and insufficient steepness.</p><p><img src=./Fox_lake.jpg alt="Fox Lake"></p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3 no-underline" href=https://benwardswards.github.io/Skiing-Rockies-Colmbias/>&copy; Backcountry Skiing in the Rockies and Columbias 2025</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
